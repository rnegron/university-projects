--- Description of the program ---

The program consists of two Python scripts, one which acts as a client
and another which works like a server. Once both are connected via socket,
the client will send a string which contains both the identifying ID of the
client (since more than one client is supported) and a random amount
of seconds which correspond to theoretical CPU clock usage. The server
receives and stores the data using one thread while another thread retrieves
the data and organizes it into a dictionary, which is displayed after
a specified amount of messages have been processed. The resulting output
correspond to the sum of the theoretical CPU times for each client script
which was active during the server's lifetime.

--- How to use ---

Run the 'server' script first:

    $ python scheduler.py <server port>

Then run as many 'mobile' scripts as desired:

    $ python mobile.py <mobileID> <server address> <server port>

In modifying scheduler.py's MAX_MESSAGES global variable, the user can make
the program run for a longer period of time. The global variables in
mobile.py control the intervals within which both the CPU time and the
sleep time fall into.

--- Who helped ---

I discussed socket implementation and general code refactoring with Ricardo
López. I also visited the professor's office early on to get a better idea
of how to proceed. The following sites also helped:
